# Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease using Machine Learning

## Summary

There are currently no blood, imaging, or lab tests to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD). The process of diagnosing Parkinson’s Disease is thorough and consists of six steps. The criteria and standards of the same are set by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS). Neurologists specializing in movement-related disorders usually assess the severity of PD by following the aforementioned norms and documenting each and every step of the exam. The clinician’s level of expertise, experience, and views introduces an inherent bias in this process, which might hinder the accuracy of their decision. Two clinicians might rate the same patient differently. In this study, we propose a rather data-driven approach to tackle this problem. Our work focuses on the early detection of PD using audio measurements and analyses the suitability of using wearable sensors to assess the acuteness of motor impairment in PD patients. We achieved a 93% F1 score using the Support Vector Classifier in the first task. Pertaining to the second objective, an experiment was performed in which we achieved an 85% F1-score in detecting PD given a small, labeled wearable sensor dataset. Such proves that there is a scope for adopting the data-driven approach as it can lead to better results given more data
