# Information and Coding Theory Project

* In this course, as a project, I have implemented (*not invented*) a audio encryption-decryption algorithm from a research paper.

* I highly recommend reading **Encryption-in-handset.pdf** (research paper). It's easier to read and understand. After that you should read about **Chaotic systems**.

* Run *code.m*. I have added sections for different tasks and commented it, hopefully one will get it (structured it like jupyter notebooks). You can play original audio, encrypted audio and decrypted audio inside the code.

* You can take a look at **ICT_PPT.pdf** for summary.
